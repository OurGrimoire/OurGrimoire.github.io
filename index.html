			<p>We welcome you to Our Grimoire, an online resource and community for Wiccan, witches and warlocks, and all other magical practitioners. We are a small group of individually practicing Wiccans who hope to help introduce the interested into the sometimes complicated world of Wicca. We can't possibly know what you are particularly going through, but we hope to give you information to discover your inner Wiccan</p>
			<p>Please don't take anything on this site as completely correct. Part of Wicca is its fluidity. Anything you find on this site can and should be changed to fit your personal preferences, lifestyle, and particular beliefs. This is only a presentation of our style of Wiccan practice. </p></td>
