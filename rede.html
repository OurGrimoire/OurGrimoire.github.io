      <p style="text-indent: 0px; text-align: center; color: black"><b>B</b>ide within the Law you must, in perfect Love and perfect Trust.<br>
		  Live you must and let to live, fairly take and fairly give.<br><br>

			For tread the Circle thrice about to keep unwelcome spirits out.<br>
To bind the spell well every time, let the spell be said in rhyme.<br><br>

Light of eye and soft of touch, speak you little, listen much.<br>
Honor the Old Ones in deed and name,<br>
let love and light be our guides again.<br><br>

Deosil go by the waxing moon, chanting out the joyful tune.<br>
Widdershins go when the moon doth wane,<br>
and the werewolf howls by the dread wolfsbane.<br><br>

When the Lady's moon is new, kiss the hand to Her times two.<br>
When the moon rides at Her peak then your heart's desire seek.<br><br>

Heed the North winds mighty gale, lock the door and trim the sail.<br>
When the Wind blows from the East, expect the new and set the feast.<br><br>

When the wind comes from the South, love will kiss you on the mouth.<br>
When the wind whispers from the West, all hearts will find peace and rest.<br><br>

Nine woods in the Cauldron go, burn them fast and burn them slow.<br>
Birch in the fire goes to represent what the Lady knows.<br><br>

Oak in the forest towers with might, in the fire it brings the God's<br>
insight.   Rowan is a tree of power causing life and magick to flower.<br><br>

Willows at the waterside stand ready to help us to the Summerland.<br>
Hawthorn is burned to purify and to draw faerie to your eye.<br><br>

Hazel-the tree of wisdom and learning adds its strength to the bright fire burning.<br>
White are the flowers of Apple tree that brings us fruits of fertility.<br><br>

Grapes grow upon the vine giving us both joy and wine.<br>
Fir does mark the evergreen to represent immortality seen.<br><br>

Elder is the Lady's tree burn it not or cursed you'll be.<br>
Four times the Major Sabbats mark in the light and in the dark.<br><br>

As the old year starts to wane the new begins, it's now Samhain.<br>
When the time for Imbolc shows watch for flowers through the snows.<br><br>

When the wheel begins to turn soon the Beltane fires will burn.<br>
As the wheel turns to Lamas night power is brought to magick rite.<br><br>

Four times the Minor Sabbats fall use the Sun to mark them all.<br>
When the wheel has turned to Yule light the log the Horned One rules.<br><br>

In the spring, when night equals day time for Ostara to come our way.<br>
When the Sun has reached it's height time for Oak and Holly to fight.<br><br>

Harvesting comes to one and all when the Autumn Equinox does fall.<br>
Heed the flower, bush, and tree by the Lady blessed you'll be.<br><br>

Where the rippling waters go cast a stone, the truth you'll know.<br>
When you have and hold a need, harken not to others greed.<br><br>

With a fool no season spend or be counted as his friend.<br>
Merry Meet and Merry Part bright the cheeks and warm the heart.<br><br>

Mind the Three-fold Laws you should three times bad and three times good.<br>
When misfortune is enow wear the star upon your brow.<br>

Be true in love this you must do unless your love is false to you.<br><br>

These Eight words the Rede fulfill:<br><br>
