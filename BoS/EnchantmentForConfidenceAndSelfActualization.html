		<p>This spell is designed to help you bring about the self-improvement you want. This spell cannot simply improve you. You will need to still work hard, and this spell can not fix everything about you, but it can help you maintain focus while changing the things you have control over and find peace with those you can not.</p>
		<p>This spell calls forth the power of the Element Fire to help you know yourself better and in turn guide you to make the changes you want.</p>
	  <h2 style="text-align: right">What You'll Need</h2>
	  <p style="text-align: right">Naudhiz, mannaz, raidho, wunjo, dagaz, and sowilo runes<br>
		Equal lengths black and white thread (at least six inches each)<br>
		Paper and something to write with<br>
		A red candle<br>
		Dragon's blood, frankincense, or cinnamon incense.</p>
	  <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Begin the spell by setting up your altar and lighting both the Goddess and God candles, then light your incense. Next place the red candle between them and light it to call to the Element Fire.</p>
		<p>Now, write exactly what you dislike about yourself that you would like to change. This can be a single trait or a list, but it must be specific. Then, tie the two lengths of thread together. This represent the fact that the flaw(s) you wrote on the paper are a part of you.</p>
		<p>Fold the paper until it can fit in your hand. Place it in the center of your pentagram and place the naudhiz rune on top. The naudhiz represent a challenge which you must overcome. You will now place each of the other five runes at each point of the pentagram like so:</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 0px; text-align: center"><img src="../images/Runes0.png" style="width: 50%;" align="middle"/></p>
		<p>As you place the mannas rune repeat this:</p>
		<p class="quote">"Element of Fire,<br>
		Help me know myself."</p>
		<p>As you place the raidho runes repeat this:</p>
		<p class="quote">"Element of Fire,<br>
		Help me travel beyond my flaws."</p>
		<p>As you place the wunjo rune repeat this:</p>
		<p class="quote">"Element of Fire,<br>
		Help me find my own peace."</p>
		<p>As you place the dagaz rune repeat this:</p>
		<p class="quote">"Element of Fire,<br>
		Help me see a brighter tomorrow."</p>
		<p>As you place the sowilo rune repeat this:</p>
		<p class="quote">"Element of Fire,<br>
		Help me see the light inside myself.</p>
		<p>You should now sit and meditate, envisioning the future in which you are at piece with yourself. Once you feel centered, take the thread by the white end and hold it above the red candle, allowing the other end to burn. Place the thread in your cauldron once you can no longer hold it. This represents your understanding that your perceived flaws make you who you are and destroying them would destroy you.</p>
		<p>Remove the runes in the order they were placed. Repeat the following over and over until each rune has been removed:</p>
		<p class="quote">"I thank you Element of Fire,<br>
		For your help and light."</p>
		<p>To complete the enchantment, take the folded piece of paper from the center of the pentagram and light it on fire using the red candle. Place it in your cauldron and allow it to burn. It is recommended to keep the ashes of the paper and thread in a small container and keep it on your person.</p>
