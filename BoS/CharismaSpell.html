		<p>This spell can help you feel more confident in yourself which often is the most helpful thing any magic can do for you. This spell calls on the help of the moon goddes, Selene, to help bring a shine to your self-image.</p>
	  <h2 style="text-align: right">What You'll Need</h2>
	  <p style="text-align: right">A white candle<br>
		A black candle<br>
		A pink candle<br>
		Five rose petals<br>
		A bowl of spring water<br>
		Your favorite perfume</p>
	  <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Begin by placing the three candles on your altar to form a triangle: the white candle at the top, the black candle to the left, and the pink candle to the right. Light each candle. Set the bowl of spring water on the altar, and then drop the rose petals into the bowl of spring water. Close your eyes and center yourself for about five minute.</p>
		<p>One by one, remove the rose petals from the water and place them on the altar in front of you. As you do this, repeat the following incantation:</p>
		<p class="quote">"With each petal my beauty grows<br>
		Within, without, and all about<br>
		Hair, skin, face, and inner wealth<br>
		As divine as the goddes, wild but svelte."</p>
		<p>Take all of the rose petals in your hand. Add a small amount of perfume to the bowl of spring water followed by the petals. To apply the potion, take a rose betal and rub the moisture into your skin behind your knees, on the inside of your elbows, on your wrists, on your neck, and on your temples. As you do this repeat:</p>
		<p class="quote">"By the power of the cosmos, moon, and sun<br>
		By the power of three be done<br>
		By the power of three, times two and three<br>
		As I will, so mote it be."</p>
		<p>Place all of the rose petals back into the bowl of spring water. Reapply the potion as often as you feel needed. On the even of the next full moon, pour the remaining mixture away. As you do this repeat this spell:</p>
		<p class="quote">"Thrice I have charisma fine.<br>
		Thrice this beauty will be mine.<br>
		Thrice I shine, and thrice I win.<br>
		Both those to me whose love they'll bring."</p>
		<p>For the next two months, the attention you seek will find you because of your increased charisma.</p>
